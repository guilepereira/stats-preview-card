## My process

In this project I tried to improve my coding process based on the perceptions and feedbacks I had in previous projects, so my focus was to refine my accuracy in achieving the proposed design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS Variables (Custom properties);
- Flexbox;
- Grid;
- Accessibility;
- Mobile First;
- Methodology BEM (Block Element Modifier);
- Atomic Design.

### What I learned

In this project I was challenged when I needed to think of alternatives to adapt the layout using grid and also when I needed to treat an image using only css. For this last situation, I learned to use filters and also the mix-blend-mode property, which I really liked the results!
